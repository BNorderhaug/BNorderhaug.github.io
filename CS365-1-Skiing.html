		<p> Skiing has been almost second nature to me as, because for one I am of Nordic descent, and also due to the fact
		I was born and raised in the Midwest. My parents, realizing this, began to teach me how to ski at the ripe age of 5
		years old. It is something that has stayed fairly consistent in my life as nearly everyone in my family skis, and is 
		used as a family reunion of sorts.</p>
